# Terminal-Wordle
 
Terminal Wordle is a program developed in C where the user has a certain amount of attempts to guess a 5 letter word. There are visual demonstrations showing whether or not the right character is and if it's in the right or wrong spot. There is also a hint implementation where it allows the user, if they are stuck get help towards their word. This hint will give a random letter out of the word to help the user.
